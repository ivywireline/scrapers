scrapers
========

A collection of scrapers that I created over time in various languages for various purposes. 


## Scrapers

1. Reddit Scraper

### Reddit Scraper

A scraper built to crawl through the front page of reddit and download all images there. Prior to using it ensure the following dependencies are installed:

* NodeJS 
* All npm modules necessary by using the command `npm install`

Afterwards

* Create an empty folder titled `img`
* Execute our main file by `node reddit_scraper.js`
